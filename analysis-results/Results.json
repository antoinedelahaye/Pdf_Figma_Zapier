{"cause": "Surface Finish 500 on SS440 bearing casing","solution": "1. Notify OEM of bearing failure and its cause to correct engine design/manufacturing specifications. 2. Implement a monitoring system for predictive maintenance to capture operating conditions early. 3. Review and update MRO schedules to ensure compliance with lubrication levels and maintenance protocols.","analysis": "The engine failure was related to a surface finish issue on the bearing casing, leading to connecting rod failures under excessive load conditions. This suggests a need for improved quality control in manufacturing processes."}
