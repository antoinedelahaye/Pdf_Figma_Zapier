  "solution": "1. Monitor Engine Temperature: Implement remote engine operations monitoring to track heat levels and detect overheating early. 2. Adjust Lubricant Levels: Ensure lubricant levels are maintained at 100% to prevent excessive friction and heat build-up. 3. Add Auxiliary Radiator: Install an auxiliary radiator to help keep engine temperatures within safe operating limits.",
