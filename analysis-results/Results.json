{  "cause": "Engine heat exceeding recommended levels",
  "solution": "1. Identify and Service: Review all vehicles in the fleet to assess if they are affected by the overheating issue. Check the maintenance records to ensure that lubricant levels are maintained at 100% during operations. 2. Install Additional Cooling: Add an auxiliary radiator to prevent the engine heat from exceeding 80% of the recommended operating temperature. 3. Monitoring and Updates: Implement remote monitoring for engine operations to capture conditions early and mitigate potential failures. Update the maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) schedules based on findings to ensure ongoing compliance and functionality.",
