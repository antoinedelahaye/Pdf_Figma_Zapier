{"cause": "Surface Finish on bearing casing","solution": "1. Notify OEM of bearing failure and required corrections. 2. Implement a regular maintenance schedule to check lubrication levels and engine heat. 3. Introduce remote monitoring for predictive maintenance to capture operational conditions early.","analysis": "The analysis suggests that the engine failures are linked to a surface finish issue on the SS440 bearing casing. The pattern indicates that improper surface finishes can lead to bearing failures, which subsequently cause engine breakdowns. Historical data shows that similar failures have occurred previously due to inadequate lubrication and overheating."}
