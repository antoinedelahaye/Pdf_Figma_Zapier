{"cause": "Surface Finish issues on bearing casing","solution": "1. Notify OEM of bearing failure and potential design flaws. 2. Implement a routine maintenance check for lubrication levels to ensure they remain optimal. 3. Consider adding an auxiliary radiator to keep engine heat within safe operating limits.","analysis": "The analysis indicates that the engine failure was linked to surface finish issues on the SS440 bearing casing, which can lead to dislodged shafts and connecting rod failures under stress. This aligns with previous occurrences documented in the knowledge graph."}
