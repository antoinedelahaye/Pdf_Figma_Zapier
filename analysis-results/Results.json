{  "cause": "Engine overheating due to lubrication failure.",
  "solution": "1. Validate Lubricant Levels: Check and service lubricant levels to ensure they meet 100% of the recommended specifications. 2. Monitor Engine Temperature: Install an auxiliary radiator to maintain engine temperature below 80% of its maximum operational threshold. 3. Implement Predictive Maintenance: Establish remote monitoring of engine operations to capture and address any deviations from optimal conditions early.",
